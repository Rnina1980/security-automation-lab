📊 Failed Login Threat Dashboard (Explanation)

This folder contains Splunk dashboards used in my Security Automation Lab, specifically built to demonstrate SOC-style detection, analysis, and visualization.

🔐 Overview

The Failed Login Threat Dashboard is designed to help identify:

High-risk user accounts

High-risk source IPs

Total failed authentication attempts

Patterns that may indicate brute-force or reconnaissance activity

This dashboard visualizes output generated by a Python detection script (failed_logins_parser.py) that parses simulated authentication logs.

🧠 What This Dashboard Shows
1. Failed Login Attempts by User/IP (Bar Chart)

This panel aggregates detection output to show:

Which user accounts have the most failed login attempts

Which IP addresses are repeatedly attempting authentication

Total counts of failures

Clear visual indicators of suspicious behavior

2. High-Risk Indicators

The dashboard highlights any:

User accounts exceeding failure thresholds

IPs with repeated login attempts

These mimic common SOC investigations using SIEM tools like Splunk, CrowdStrike, and Qualys.

🛠 How It Works

The detection script processes a log file and generates a summary text file (detection_output.txt).

That output is ingested into Splunk as a custom sourcetype (misc_text).

Splunk queries extract relevant fields using:

rex for parsing text

stats for aggregation

sort for ranking results

Dashboard panels then visualize the data for fast security analysis.

🎯 Purpose

This dashboard is a demonstration of:

SIEM integration

Log parsing & enrichment

Basic detection engineering

SOC analyst visualization workflows

Real-world cyber automation skills

It is designed as part of a broader AI/Automation SOC Engineer interview preparation lab.
